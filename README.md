light-bipes
====
`light-bipes` is a very basic TCP tunneling server. The intention of light-bipes is to make a
simple version of ngrok for remote access to large numbers of devices in the form of a Python library,
so that it can be integrated with other management code.

What the hell does "light bipes" mean?

The day I started writing this, my friend and I were making a dumb joke about mispronouncing "light pipes",
for reasons completely unrelated to software. It was stuck in my head, and when I was thinking of a name for
this project, I realized the name fit pretty well (lightweight pipes between machines). I'm sure I'll regret
this decision before too long.
